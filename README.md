The attached file will likely not work properly as 3 files were too large to push to github. The full project can be found here along with a demo video (.rar was the only way i can compress to upload it) - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g4KBPjxplH9CD2FDnSf6f4tglxhGTaAC 

First Person Shooter (FPS) game

Points Completed In Game
1) Mountainious terrain along with an urban environment. The environment is closed with cliffs and walls.
2) Two weapons implemented a riffle, pistol along with a melee weapon and a grenade.
3) Life Bar, Armour with differen health and damage ratings. Also applied armour to protect player.
4) Visual UI of both armour and HP along with other details like ammo and gun is also implemented.
5) Locked doors implemented
6) Enemy patrolling the streets has also been implemented, AI shooting at players implemented
7) Sound Effects implemented. Shoot, hurt,jump,fall etc
8) GameOver screen as well as restart when the player dies is also implemented.

Bonus Point
2) Player can respawn and start over where he left.
3) DeadZones like walls and cliffs are implemented to stop the player from going the area.

In the video you can check the armour going down as well as the health. I did not change anything in the code. Sometimes the enemy does critical damage, like a headshot therefore the armour doesnt take hits.

Overall Process: Unity is proving to be much mroe difficult than anticipated however, there are alot of resources online to ease the process and learn new things.
